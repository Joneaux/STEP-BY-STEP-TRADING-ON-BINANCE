Considering the CBN in Nigeria's restriction on cryptocurrency, we will make use of Peer2Peer(P2P) option which simply means transferring money from your bank to another user on binance to buy your desired coin. All you have to do select a user from the list, input the amount you intend to send which is equivalent to the amount of coin you will get from the user directly into your wallet on binance. 
<strong>NOTE: All transaction must be carried out on Binance only, because a third party app might put you at risk </strong>
From a list of users who are willing to sell USDt in the naira equivalent you are sending to them, Open your Binance app, look for P2P in the top right corner, click buy and highlight USDT <img src="https://imgur.com/8rGrMOx" alt="List of USdt sellers">
